my progress with gaining root on the Franklin T10 hotspot modem

My first course of action was gaining a console, this was pretty easy as the device has a pair of TX/RX pads on the mainboard. 
upon giving the device power it initially didn't do all that much aside from some bootloader information but pressing the powerbutton began the boot process leading me to discover the entire boot process was fully exposed.
